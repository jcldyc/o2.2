This is the second project in  Operating Systems with Mark Hauschild.

Concurrent UNIX Processes and shared memory:

GOAL: become familiar with concurrent processing in Unix/Linux using shared memory.

Project 2:
1)Read file into main that contains words, one on each line.
2)Stores those strings into shared memory
3)Array of pointers called *mylist[] that holds pointers pointing to the beginning of a string in shared memory
4)The main program while spawn at max 20 processes to determine if the string is a palindrome
5)the process will output the PID, Index #, and String into the appropriate file
